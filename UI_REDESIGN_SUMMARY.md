## Content Preservation
All original functionality has been preserved:

- âœ… API integration maintained
- âœ… All text content preserved
- âœ… Business logic untouched

## How to View
The development server is running at:

The CSS file shows warnings for `@tailwind` and `@apply` directives - these are expected and do not affect functionality. They're standard Tailwind CSS directives that work perfectly at runtime.

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
If you want to take it further, consider:
- Add dark mode toggle
- Implement more page transitions
